|        6  We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
|        7  drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
|        8  at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
|        9  be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
|       10  must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work   |
|       11  together, learning from each other, not to divide the work|into
|       12  two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.|
